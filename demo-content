Introduction (15 seconds)
"Today, I’ll show how GitHub Copilot enhances security and efficiency for our AWS Lambda functions at [Company Name]. We’ll focus on ensuring Python versions are 3.10 or higher, critical for compliance and reliability. Copilot helps our cloud operations team deliver secure code faster while boosting productivity."

Business Value (30 seconds)
"Our AWS Lambda applications automate operational tasks for mortgage processing, but outdated Python versions risk security vulnerabilities and regulatory non-compliance. Manually writing Checkov policies to enforce version standards is time-intensive, slowing our ability to meet audit requirements. Copilot automates this, cutting policy creation time by 40% and unit test development by 35%. By catching issues early, we strengthen data security and ensure compliance with mortgage regulations. This efficiency frees developers to optimize our operational workflows, supporting system reliability and customer trust."

Demo (60 seconds)
"Let’s see Copilot in action. In Visual Studio Code, I need a Checkov policy to flag Lambda functions using Python below 3.10. [Show screen: type a prompt, Copilot suggests YAML policy code.] Copilot suggests a precise policy in seconds, ensuring compliance 40% faster than manual coding. Now, for unit tests: [Show screen: start a pytest file, Copilot suggests test cases for Lambda.] Copilot generates a test suite for version-specific behavior, saving 35% of testing time. These streamlined workflows let our team focus on enhancing operational automation, not repetitive tasks."
